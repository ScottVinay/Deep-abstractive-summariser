# Deep-abstractive-summariser
An ongoing project to develop a sequence-to-sequence model that can summarise text. This is currently working on data from WikiHow, but with an aim to move to generating titles for scientific papers.

Note: This is still in the early stages, but operational. The notebook is intended to work on Google Colab and draws data from my Drive. The first few cells may be modified to allow it to work on another machine.

Some sample outcomes:

A budget can be extremely useful, because then you know exactly where your money is going, and whether you can afford certain things or notfor instance, if you know your budget only allots 40 for food per week, you will immediately know that you shouldnt spend 10 of that on a single fast food meal.
