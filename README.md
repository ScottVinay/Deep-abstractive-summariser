# Deep-abstractive-summariser
An ongoing project to develop a sequence-to-sequence model that can summarise text. This is currently working on data from WikiHow, but with an aim to move to generating titles for scientific papers.

Note: This is still in the early stages, but operational. The notebook is intended to work on Google Colab and draws data from my Drive. The first few cells may be modified to allow it to work on another machine.
